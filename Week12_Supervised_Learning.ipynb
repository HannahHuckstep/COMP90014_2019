    "\n",
    "This week will be a bit odd as you will be doing the tutorials alongside the lectures. Between this tutorial and the exam review there will not be a lot of time during the tutorial for me to teach the basics and then have you practice coding. For this reason I have provided links to online tutorials to learn how to code some basic classifiers by yourself and I will go through the confusion matrix in the tutorials (on the board). The confusion matrix is something you can do without a computer that is relatively easy to grasp without having gone to the lectures first. I encourage you to revisit links to the online classifier tutorials after the week 12 lectures."

    "In general, a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and then tries to predict properties of unknown data. If each sample is more than a single number and, for instance, a multi-dimensional entry (aka multivariate data), it is said to have several attributes or features.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Supervised learning**, in which the data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict [Click here to go to the scikit-learn supervised learning page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning).This problem can be either:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Classification**: samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data. An example of a classification problem would be handwritten digit recognition, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories. Another way to think of classification is as a discrete (as opposed to continuous) form of supervised learning where one has a limited number of categories and for each of the n samples provided, one is to try to label them with the correct category or class.\n",
    " - **Regression**: if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a function of its age and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning**, in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization [Click here to go to the Scikit-Learn unsupervised learning page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html#unsupervised-learning).\n",
